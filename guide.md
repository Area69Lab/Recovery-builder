## Little Guide for Manifest command ##

### So yea, I'm quite sorry if I really messed up your builds cuz I didn't say all stuff correctly. ###

Here's a full guide on the "Manifest" variable.

#### What is the manifest variable ####

It determines the branch and the manifest link of the recovery you wanna build.

Here's the syntax and an example. 

``` 
<manifest link> <branch>
```

```
git://github.com/SKYHAWK-Recovery-Project/platform_manifest_twrp_omni.git -b android-9.0
```

So if you have any problems, read this.


Thank you.
